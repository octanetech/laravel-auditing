# FleetFoot Auditing  
## Based on [Laravel Auditing](https://github.com/owen-it/laravel-auditing)


Laravel Auditing allows you to record changes to an Eloquent model's set of data by simply adding its trait to your model. Laravel Auditing also provides a simple interface for retreiving an audit trail for a piece of data and allows for a great deal of customization in how that data is provided.

### Official Documentation

Documentation for the package can be found on the [Laravel Auditing website](http://www.laravel-auditing.com) or [Documentation Repository](https://github.com/owen-it/laravel-auditing-doc/blob/2.4/README.md).
